# Dogs-v-Cats-Classification
This is a dogs-v-cats classification using Tensorflow and Opencv

This dataset is based on Kaggel Challange 6 years ago. The link to the challange is: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

This notebook uses tensorflow to design a CNN for a dog or cat classification. It uses OpenCV to use the images in the grayscale mode and to resize the image so to make the model more efficient.

The model has a validation accuracy of around 71%. The model can be trained for more than 2 epochs to get better results.
